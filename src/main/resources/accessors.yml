# Magicmenu

# You can define accessors to forms or specific commands here.
# Note: allowed-users exist only for emote-accessors; since for commands you can just give the permission with a permissions manager.

# Here, you can define commands as quick access to any command form (or command; although that is fairly useless)

  - command: "/magicmenu example"
    permission: "magicmenu.example"
    aliases:

# Here, you can define emotes as quick access to any command/form
# You need to enter an emote-uuid; or "all" so the accessor runs on all emotes (not recommended). Get emote uuids from here:
